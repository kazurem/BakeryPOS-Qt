# Bakery POS System  
A Bakery Management System that streamlines many bakery processes.

## Project Details:  
1. This isn't a dummy project. We were required to find a real client.
2. We were allowed to use anything to make the frontend.  we chose Qt.
3. Using MySQL was a must.
4. This was a group project. Total number of members for the group was 4.
5. We were required to follow SDLC."# BakeryPOS-Qt" 
## Guidelines for contributing:
1. **Pull often** so that so you are working on the latest version of the code.  
2. **Don't push too many changes at once**. One commit or pull request should mainly focus on one problem or feature. This will make managing things easier. It will also make resolving merge conflicts easier in case they arise.
3. Each member should ideally **work** on **different sections of the code**. This is to prevent merge conflicts.
4. **Don't work directly on main branch**. Always make a branch from which you will make changes, commit, push and open a pull request.
